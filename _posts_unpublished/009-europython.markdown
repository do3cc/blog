Alex Martelli API Design anti-patterns

I have great experience at bad API Design

When creating an API we think about many things, security,
performance, correctness, user interface, elegance...

Patterns:
I tell you what I will tell you
I will tell you,
I tell you what I told you.

I will not give real examples, I don't want more enemies.
Except windows API

What is api
Application Program Interface.

What is an anti pattern

category of counterproductive behaviors that are often repeated

Analysis:
root cause analysis:
Not because it seemed like a good idea, but why did it seem like a
good idea at that time.

Why is it actually bad.

How to prevent that in the future
