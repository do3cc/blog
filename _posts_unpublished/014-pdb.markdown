title: Getting notified when pdb pops up remote or local
---
Currently I am trying to make non ascii handling in GenericSetup a bit saner.
I am trying it in a way that would break a number of packages in plone, so I am running all tests from coredev.
These tests run a while and I am not willing to sit in front of the screen waiting for a pdb to pop up for half an hour.

With current ubuntus and probably other systems too, it is possible to get notified when a pdb pops up. Even over the network. Here is how:

On a current ubuntu you should have libnotify installed. Check that you have the notify-send script installed by executing the following command::

  $ notify-send test

If it did not work, install it via::

  $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

Next, install pdbpp, I wrote about it in an <a href="#">earlier Blog Post</a>::

  $ easy\_install pdbpp

You can customize pdbpp, and one customization option is to run a script if the pdb pops up and ther terminal is inactive. But for this to work, it needs another program, wmctrl. On Ubuntu, you can install it via::

  $ sudo apt-get install wmctrl

Next we need to customize pdbpp, create a file in your home directory, named .pdbrc.py::

  from pdb import DefaultConfig

  class Config(DefaultConfig):
      exec_if_unfocused = 'notify-send "PDB"'

Now try it::

  sleep 3; python import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
