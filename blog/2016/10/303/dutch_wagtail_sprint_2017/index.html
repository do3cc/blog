  <h2>Edd Baldry</h2>
<h2>Ben van't Ende - Building an Open Source Community</h2>
<p>I know Four digits for years. They evolved quite a bit and are very community oriented.
I am community manager/evangelist(?) for Typo 3.
My first conference I can reach by bike.
How should we start building a community.
Just start! Start simple and talk with your community.
How to maintain and grow your community.
Take care of diversity, no xx first!
Three points to take core of</p>
<p>Survey, 35k people were questioned about main qualities of communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social offerings</li>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Area aesthetics.
How to apply this to technical communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Openness, how welcome is the community. How do you engage with the community.
What is the purpose of your community.
Linus Torvalds: Just get shit done (regarding purpose)
Being too focused, hinders engagement.
Soft Skills: A community needs ... too fast, positive things.
Don't ignore the shy people, try to engage them too.
Engagement.
Purpose</p>
<h2>Daniele</h2>
<p>Divio. Django CMS Developer. Was on tv</p>
<p>Divio is a hosting platform. Hosting as a service.</p>
<p>Aimed at develoeprs and people who don't want to be deployment experts.</p>
<p>We use docker and git.</p>
<p>We provide 3 environments, local, test, live.</p>
<p>We do not compete with agencies. We do'nt develop. Django.</p>
<p>We add expuse</p>
<p>We provide quickstart apps for django cms, wagtail and some others.</p>
<p>I can see cronjobs backups, collaborators, domains, etc.
Has a gui to instlal plugins.</p>
<p>Tool allows commits throguht the web. (I guess settings for additional apps).</p>
<p>My goal for this spring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better wagtail base project on Divio Cloud.</li>
<li>Better wagtail related docs.</li>
<li>Wagtail as a first class citizen.</li>
<li>Live wagtail project on divio cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Robin von der Rijst  - Wagtail in practice</h2>
<p>You'll hear tales from the trenches.</p>
<p>Customers want wordpress. We ask them. You really need WP?
Common misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>cheaper</li>
<li>quicker</li>
<li>better support.</li>
</ul>
<p>For sure, with the right Template, is fine. But custoemrs don't come to us if they just need a template.</p>
<p>Why wagtail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very intuitive,</li>
<li>Content Type</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not:</p>
<ul>
<li>When client already has something.</li>
<li>When they want an off the shelf solution</li>
<li>When they need a webshop.</li>
</ul>
<p>How we use it.
Some tricks I don't get yet becaue I don't do wagtail.
SinglePagePerSiteMixin, for pages that should only exist once. After that, it does not show as addable anymore.</p>
<p>Common pattern:
Page model hierarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>ProjectBasePage
Common page attributes.</li>
<li>Base page with our without visual.</li>
<li>Mixins Pageintro, pagepromo...</li>
<li>ProjectImage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Menus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainmenu, footermenu
Two solutions<ol>
<li>Custom menu app where you manage the menus per site<ul>
<li>Easy to create links to things not a page</li>
<li>More suitable for flat menus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extend the page model<ul>
<li>add menu_option to use together with built-in show_in_menus</li>
<li>Good for hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>page promotion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a default representation for a page when shown somewhere else:<ul>
<li>eg search results,</li>
<li>related pages footer,</li>
<li>facebook sharing.
Offers max control for editors.
Add as mixin, if customer says nothing, use default, else, use custom setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wagtail the bad
No file upload in forms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs custom form.
No drag'n'drop in streamfield</li>
<li>Use arrow buttons
Cannot link to page preview (editor looks at preview, tries to copy link.)
Hallo.js looks nice, but... (everybody laughs..., except me)</li>
<li>Swap it with another one.
Streamfield with a lot of content gets a bit messy.
No hierarchy for media/document</li>
<li>No folders in admin</li>
<li>No folders on disk
ModelAdmin: not quite up to par yet.</li>
<li>No admin bulk actions</li>
<li>no support for drag'n'drop sortable models.
easy_thumbnails, feature focal_image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ugly
not invented here</p>
<ul>
<li>wagtail thumbnails</li>
<li>django polymorphic (No idea)
View logic in (Page) models</li>
<li>Undoing the mvc pattern</li>
<li>verry un-dkango-y</li>
</ul>
<h2>Edd- Streamfields</h2>
<p>One of the best things in wagtail.</p>
<p>Problem, streamfield is not userfriendly from accessibility and user friendlyness view.
Deletion is fatal.
Nested streamfields are hard.
Live demo of improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li>He found a bug.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tom Dyson - Wagteil Experiments</h2>
<p>Start Charming Four digits. Good sprint, good seeing so many people.
A/B Testing for frende.no
Existing solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizely</li>
<li>VWO</li>
<li>Googl experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>Can get expensive fast. At least first two.</p>
<p>But hard requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>No markup insertion</li>
<li>All data stored in norway</li>
<li>Test creatable by editors</li>
<li>Available in 3 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixpack. ab tool written in python.fende</p>
<p>Cool, but still, we did something on our own.</p>
<p>We reimplemented facebooks fanout with django models and pluggable backends.</p>
<p>Roadmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache-friendly</li>
<li>Google analytics backend</li>
<li><p>Add personalisation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wagtails preview a new hope</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Preview seems to be broken.</p>
<p>Now showing how to break it.</p>
<p>Now showing a table of feature that continue to work, stop working and gets added.</p>
<p>Next showing quite a few problems and how they could be handled.</p>
<p>It is mostly working and then will be better than wordpress.</p>
<p>Please review #3383</p>
<h2>Matt Westcott - The Zen of Wagtail</h2>
<p>Early days, not a lot of advance planning.</p>
<p>I finally have to write down the guiding principles for developing wagtail</p>
<p>Always wear the right hat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Content Editor</li>
<li>Designer</li>
<li>Site admin</li>
</ul>
<p>Let programmers program by writing programs.
Screenshot of page to set fields.
Programmers don't need to configure fields ttw.
Shows a class diagram of what is needed for ttw field creation. Everybody is crying.</p>
<p>SiteAdmin doesn't define content types, programmers do.</p>
<p>wagtail forms example of an ui targeted at content editors.
special forms, let it make the programmer. Plone can handle that.</p>
<p>Wagtail is just the top of the stack. Don't forget about the rest.</p>
<p>Content management is about tranferring information from peopls brains into the db as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Deliver complexity when it's needed, not before.</p>
