<h2>coala Team</h2>
<p>Coala. Tradtion in giving Lighting talk.<br/>
Coala for linting and fixing every programming language<br/></p>
<p>Would you want to rewrite Libreoffice to add spellchecker for another language?<br/>
Then why do you do it with linting tool?<br/></p>
<p>Coala provides a framework to reuse linting tools for many languages.<br/>
Support 56 languages. 57 since 5 minutes.<br/>
We wrap existing tools.<br/></p>
<p>Coala can not only find problems, but also fix them.</p>
<p>Got something new: Moving from declaring the tools to use for checking to
declaring what type of checks to run, independent of programming languages.
We are looking for sponsors.</p>

<h2>Max Scholz</h2>
<p>(This is a bit incomplete, the speaker spoke in long sentences that are hard to follow if you try to summarize them in parallel. please watch the talk to get more sense out of it)</p>
<p>I told the story already at europython.<br/>
It is about me trailing in sweden.<br/>
3 years ago I needed a break from university and humans.<br/>
It was the first time I walked, it was new for me to be alone. I took a camera and made pictures. Most of my memories were pictures.<br/>
2 years ago I went again. This time, instead of taking pictures of things I liked, I just sat down and enjoyed it.<br/>
One time, I sat for 2 hours and was suddenly full of flies. Why I am the king of flies I thought. Maybe because I was sweating?<br/>
My gist: If you go for a walk, take your time, don't waste time making pictures, enhjoy your leisure time to the fullest and just watch.<br/>
My difference to europython conference talk:<br/>
I did not want to emphafize to never take pictures. I don't want to document what I am doing, I just want to enjoy what I am experiencing.<br/>
Be mor mindful about what you experience.<br/></p>

<p>Our conf wifi.<br/>
Shows how to install something for the wifi. But why?<br/>
Some live hacking for the install script.<br/>
Oh, he is making a live demo with a non licenced sublime.<br/>
So my seating neighbors told me the script was supposed to install the required
certificate to make the Enterprise WPA Login work.<br/></p>
