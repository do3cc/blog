  <p>So there was the first Dorkbot meeting in Munich, and I have been
there. It was a very nice event. What surprised me were the many
artists who are interested in Arduino. This must be good. If
people with different educational background work together, both can
learn so much more in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>I presented a project that is nearly implemented and brought some
sensors to experiment. Together with Jan I tried to get my
acceleration sensor working. I learned some things,
but sadly we did not get the sensors working at all. The analog
reading was too noisy. It was also drifting... In the end I got it
working at home. At home I tried it on the mac, and it worked
immediately. Also, at home the Arduino was connected to a mac mini
which get its power from the mains, while my laptop was running on a
battery.</p>
<p>At home I also tried to get the motors working. It is amazing how much
stuff you get done, when you read a bit. Like the <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/use.html">motorshield manual</a>
for the Ladyada motorshield.</p>
<p>I hope there is enough interest and a room for the next Dorkbot
meeting!</p>
