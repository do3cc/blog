  <p>When I joined the Zope community 15 years ago, I was shocked about the hostile behavior of MacYET to some people asking questions.</p>
<p>I thought and think that he should not alienate people, because it hurts the community.</p>
<p>Later I learned that he can be a really nice person and he never ever humiliated me. In fact, his behavior made me consider my questions more careful and I did try harder to find the solution myself, before asking in a public forum. Maybe this is his motivation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I refused to help somebody flat out telling it to the person.</p>
<p>I said some more stuff, much less harsh, about my motivation and so on, but in the end I wondered if this is the right decision or not.</p>
<p>When should one reject to help others and why?</p>
<p>I've noticed in the past, the more somebody lacks knowledge or willingness to learn, the more they start to blame you for problems after you helped them. In the case above.</p>
<p>So this is my definition from now on: I won't help you, if even with my help you won't be able to take responsibility for your actions afterwards.</p>
<p>But if I stop here, I might just start to collect enemies. I've reached a point wher I had to say no more. But now, how to fix this?</p>
<p>There can be a few reasons, why the person has reached a point where he can't do his tasks any more.</p>
<p>Can you be unable to do your tasks because you just lack a lot of knowledge or training? What is a lot? Me doing heart surgery would be a lot of lack. Me writing a kernel driver might be a lot but I am confident that with my knowledge earned during university I can figure it out. Not everybody working in IT studied that in university. But if you managed to get into IT, you most probably managed to do so because you are very good at learning new things.
So, if you really missing a lot you probably faked yourself into that position. In such a case, no co worker can fix the problem.</p>
<p>Another reason might be lack of initiave. This can have many reasons. Unhappy with the employer. Unhappy with the co workers, Unhappy with the tasks at hand, Problems in live. Having a depression. I remember from my time in university that quite a few students I met weren't interested in doing development. They chose to learn it as a path to management. Such a person might indeed become very unhappy with the task at hand. I remember that I was working with somebody who really really hard a hard time in understanding stuff. Since we came along well, after we stopped working together he told me that he was unhappy with what he was doing. It is amazing how much this can drag your abilities down.</p>
<p>Lack of initiative is another reason this can happen. Why would somebody show no initiative? Maybe because he does not get rewarded or even punished. If you get evaluated by the number of tickets you close each day, spending a lot of time on one ticket will punish you. Sometimes, shame of not knowing how to do something or fear not being able to do something might show up as lack of initiative, especially when working remote.</p>
<p>Ok, how to get around this?
Many of the reasons above are in the circle of influence of direct co workers and the boss.</p>
