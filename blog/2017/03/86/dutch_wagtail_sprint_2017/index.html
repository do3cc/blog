  <h2>Edd Baldry</h2>
<p>Edd gave a wonderful talk about agile development with Wagtail.<br>
I listened, but I did not yet start taking notes.</p>
<h2>Ben van't Ende - Building an Open Source Community</h2>
<p>I know Four Digits for years. They evolved quite a bit and are very community oriented.<br>
I am community manager/evangelist for Typo 3.<br>
My first conference I can reach by bike.<br>
How should we start building a community.<br>
Just start! Start simple and talk with your community.<br>
How to maintain and grow your community.<br>
Take care of diversity, no Netherlands/Europe/America first!<br>
Survey, 35k people were questioned about main qualities of communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social offerings</li>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Area aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to apply this to technical communities.<br>
Three points to take care of:</p>
<p>Openness: how welcoming is the community. How do you engage with the community.</p>
<p>Purpose: What is the purpose of your community.<br>
Linus Torvalds: Just get shit done (regarding purpose)<br>
Being too focused, hinders engagement.</p>
<p>Engagement:<br>
Soft Skills: A community needs ... (too fast, positive things).<br>
Don't ignore the shy people, try to engage them too.<br></p>
<h2>Daniele Procida - Divio and Wagtail</h2>
<p>Divio. Django CMS Developer.</p>
<p>Divio is a hosting platform. Hosting as a service.<br>
Aimed at developers and people who don't want to be deployment experts.<br>
We use docker and git.<br>
We provide 3 environments, local, test, live.<br>
We do not compete with agencies. We don't develop Django.<br>
We add exposure.<br>
We provide quickstart apps for django cms, wagtail and some others.<br></p>
<pre><code>On screenshots I can see cronjobs backups, collaborators, domains, etc.
Has a gui to install plugins.
Tool allows commits through the web. (I guess settings for additional apps).
</code></pre>
<p>My goal for this spring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better wagtail base project on Divio Cloud.</li>
<li>Better wagtail related docs.</li>
<li>Wagtail as a first class citizen.</li>
<li>Live wagtail project on divio cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Robin von der Rijst  - Wagtail in practice</h2>
<p>You'll hear tales from the trenches.</p>
<p>Customers want wordpress. We ask them. You really need WP?
Common misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>cheaper</li>
<li>quicker</li>
<li>better support.</li>
</ul>
<p>For sure, with the right Template, it is fine. But customers don't come to us if they just need a template.</p>
<p>Why wagtail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very intuitive,</li>
<li>Content Type</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not:</p>
<ul>
<li>When client already has something</li>
<li>When they want an off the shelf solution</li>
<li>When they need a webshop</li>
</ul>
<p>How we use it.</p>
<pre><code>Some tricks I don't get yet becaue I don't do wagtail.
</code></pre>
<p>SinglePagePerSiteMixin, for pages that should only exist once. After that, it does not show as addable anymore.</p>
<p>Common patterns</p>
<p>Page model hierarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>ProjectBasePage
Common page attributes.</li>
<li>Base page with our without visual.</li>
<li>Mixins Pageintro, pagepromo...</li>
<li>ProjectImage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Menus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainmenu, footermenu
Two solutions<ol>
<li>Custom menu app where you manage the menus per site<ul>
<li>Easy to create links to things not a page</li>
<li>More suitable for flat menus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extend the page model<ul>
<li>add menu_option to use together with built-in show_in_menus</li>
<li>Good for hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>page promotion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a default representation for a page when shown somewhere else:<ul>
<li>eg search results,</li>
<li>related pages footer,</li>
<li>facebook sharing.
Offers max control for editors.<br>
Add as mixin, if customer says nothing, use default, else, use custom setting.<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wagtail the bad<br>
No file upload in forms.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Needs custom form.
No drag'n'drop in streamfield<br></li>
<li>Use arrow buttons
Cannot link to page preview (editor looks at preview, tries to copy link.)<br>
Hallo.js looks nice, but... (everybody laughs..., except me)<br></li>
<li>Swap it with another one.
Streamfield with a lot of content gets a bit messy.<br>
No hierarchy for media/document<br></li>
<li>No folders in admin</li>
<li>No folders on disk
ModelAdmin: not quite up to par yet.<br></li>
<li>No admin bulk actions</li>
<li>no support for drag'n'drop sortable models.
easy_thumbnails, feature focal_image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ugly<br>
not invented here<br></p>
<ul>
<li>wagtail thumbnails</li>
<li>django polymorphic (No idea)
View logic in (Page) models<br></li>
<li>Undoing the mvc pattern</li>
<li>verry un-django-y</li>
</ul>
<h2>Edd Baldry - Streamfields</h2>
<p>One of the best things in wagtail.</p>
<p>Problem, streamfield is not userfriendly from accessibility and user friendlyness view.<br>
Deletion is fatal.<br>
Nested streamfields are hard.<br>
Live demo of improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li>He found a bug.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tom Dyson - Wagtail Experiments</h2>
<p>Start Charming Four Digits. Good sprint, good seeing so many people.<br>
A/B Testing for frende.no<br>
Existing solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizely</li>
<li>VWO</li>
<li>Google experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>Can get expensive fast. At least first two.</p>
<p>But hard requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>No markup insertion</li>
<li>All data stored in Norway</li>
<li>Test creatable by editors</li>
<li>Available in 3 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixpack. ab tool written in python.fende</p>
<p>Cool, but still, we did something on our own.</p>
<p>We reimplemented facebooks fanout with django models and pluggable backends.</p>
<p>Roadmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache-friendly</li>
<li>Google analytics backend</li>
<li>Add personalisation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bertrand Bordage - Wagtails preview a new hope</h2>
<p>Preview seems to be broken.</p>
<p>Now showing how to break it.<br>
Now showing a table of feature that continue to work, stop working and gets added.<br>
Next showing quite a few problems and how they could be handled.<br>
It is mostly working and then will be better than wordpress.<br></p>
<p>Please review <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/3383">https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/3383</a></p>
<pre><code>I was surprised about having a talk about a Pull Request. 
But from the comments and realized that this was actually quite clever.
The PR seemed to touch some behaviors for which there is no major consensus 
but strong opinion.

<h2>Matt Westcott - The Zen of Wagtail</h2>
<p>Early days, not a lot of advance planning<br>
I finally have to write down the guiding principles for developing wagtail</p>
<p>Always wear the right hat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Content Editor</li>
<li>Designer</li>
<li>Site admin</li>
</ul>
<p>Let programmers program by writing programs.<br>
Screenshot of page to set fields.<br>
Programmers don't need to configure fields ttw.<br>
Shows a class diagram of what is needed for ttw field creation. Everybody is crying.</p>
<p>SiteAdmin doesn't define content types, programmers do.</p>
<p>wagtail forms example of an ui targeted at content editors.<br>
special forms, let it make the programmer.<br></p>
<p>Wagtail is just the top of the stack. Don't forget about the rest.</p>
<p>Content management is about transferring information from peoples brains into the db as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Deliver complexity when it's needed, not before.</p>
